# Abstract

   Primary purpose of making the software is to create an automatic system which will provide an easy and alternate way to book a ticket for a movie. The customer will need to enter the information related to film after which the system will provide options to book the ticket. The staff of the cinema hall won’t have to do anything for the ticket booking as the process will be done by the customer through the software which will reduce the amount of staff required in the booking counter.
